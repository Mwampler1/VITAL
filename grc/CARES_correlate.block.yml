id: CARES_autocorrelate
label: Correlate
category: '[CARES]'
documentation: |-
  This block generates a sample correlation matrix for the input vector comprised of values drawn from the receive channels. 
  Args:
  inputs: Number of inputs to the block
  snapshot_size: Determines num. of samples used to compute the sample correlation matrix
  overlap_size: Overlap size between snapshots
  avg_method: Use either standard forward-averaging method or a forward-backward averaging method to compute the sample correlation matrix.

templates:
  imports: import CARES
  make: CARES.correlate(${num_inputs}, ${snapshot_size}, ${overlap_size}, ${avg_method})

#  Make one 'parameters' list entry for every parameter you want settable from the GUI.
#     Keys include:
#     * id (makes the value accessible as \$keyname, e.g. in the make entry)
#     * label (label shown in the GUI)
#     * dtype (e.g. int, float, complex, byte, short, xxx_vector, ...)
